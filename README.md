### 🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors – Python Edition

A fun little **command-line game** where you face off against the computer in the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors battle. First one to hit 3 points takes the crown! 🏆

* 🎤 **Voice feedback** with `pyttsx3` that tells you if you win, lose, or draw.
* 💻 Super simple to play – just type your move and hit Enter.
* 🛑 Quit anytime by typing `quit` (but can you really leave before winning?)

1. Run the game in your terminal.
2. Type `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
3. Beat the computer to 3 points and enjoy the victory announcement!
